2015-08-03

The 3-letter site identification code for Ushuaia, Argentina (TDF) was 
changed to USH to be consistent with the WMO GAWSIS. 

2011-10-07

We have introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA and INSTAAR that made the actual measurement.
We can now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace 
gas species in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

We have also changed the file naming convention (see section "DATA - FILE 
NAME DESCRIPTION").

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Project-specific notes:

2015-11-20

Updated the content and format of event files to include elevation in 
meters above sea level (masl) and sample collection intake height in 
meters above ground level (magl). Elevation plus collection intake 
height equals altitude, which has always been included in the NOAA 
distribution. In adding these 2 fields, the event number column
has moved. The new format is described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.

2013-08-27

Coordinates of some of the sample locations have changed.
These changes improve the specified location based on new
information.  Changes tend to be minor and do not necessarily
reflect a change in the actual sampling location.

2011-10-01

The data file format has been modified to include the measurement group
and, additionally, the sample collection and analysis times now include
second information (e.g., 2011 03 15 23 06 12).  See section 7.3 for
details.

2010-10-01

The format of the NOAA ESRL data records has been changed to include
an estimate of the uncertainty associated with each measurement.  The
determination of the estimate is trace gas specific and described in
section 6 (INTRODUCTION).

6. INTRODUCTION

All samples in this archive were analyzed for light hydrocarbons at INSTAAR,
Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL) in Boulder, Colorado
by gas chromatography. ARL started NMHC measurements in samples from
the NOAA CMDL network in 2005, analyzing flasks from a dozen sites
at first and then rapidly extending the coverage to more than 40 sites.

ARL has also been running in-situ measurements at Pico (Azores)
and at Summit (Greenland) alongside the flask samples.

In-situ data from the Deutscher Wetterdienst in Hohenpeissenberg (HPB)
is also regularly compared to flask samples collected at this site.

The INSTAAR NMHC laboratory was audited by the World Calibration Center (WCC)
for Volatile Organic Compounds in 2008.  All measurement results passed
the quality criteria set by the WCC.

This NMHC monitoring is the centerpiece of the World Meteorological
Organization Global Atmospheric Watch Volatile Organic Compound program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Method:

The GC analysis involves drying of approximately 600 cc (STP)
of sample gas, then preconcentration of analytes on an adsorbent bed,
followed by thermal desorption onto a short capillary guard column
and main capillary column (HP-Plot AL2O3/KCl 0.53 mm x 60 m) for separation,
and finally detection by a Flame Ionization Detector (FID).
The gas chromatograph used is a HP-5890 series II.
Drying is accomplished by running the sample gas through a tube cooled
to -25°C. The custom-built preconcentration system is cooled to -35°C
and uses Carboxen 1000 and Carboxen 1016 as adsorbents.
Desorption is controlled at 310°C.  The flask analysis system is
completely automated, allowing analysis of up to 12 flasks in one sequence.

Calibration:

Analysis of air samples are compared to analysis of synthetic
and compressed air standards.  One compressed air standard is run
twice a day to check on the stability of the FID response, the other 
standards are ran at least twice a month to determine the response of 
the FID.  Blanks are prepared by running compressed air through a heated 
bed of PtO.  Blank samples are analyzed twice daily.

Results:

Results are expressed as mole fractions (pmol/mol)

Uncertainty:

Reproducibility varies by compound and with mole fraction.
It is monitored routinely using the results of the paired flask sampling.
Reproducibility is typically better than 5% RSD.
Lower RSDs are obtained for the higher abundance compounds (ethane, propane).
Accuracy is determined by the calibration standard scale.
A minimum of three independently prepared and cross-referenced standards
is in use at any given time.  Deviations in the response factors
from these different standards are smaller than 5%, with results
for ethane and propane typically being equal or less than 2-3%.

The Pacific Ocean Cruise (POC, travelling between the US west coast
and New Zealand or Australia) data have been merged and grouped into 
5 degree latitude bins.  For the South China Sea cruises (SCS) the 
data are grouped in 3 degree latitude bins.

Sampling frequencies are approximately weekly for the fixed sites
and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for POC and
about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.

Historically, samples have been collected using two general methods:
flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump, or opening a
stopcock on an evacuated glass flask; since 28 April 2003, only the
former method is used.  During each sampling event, a pair of flasks
is filled.

For a summary of sampling locations, please visit

<A HREF='http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/site/site_table.html#ccg_surface'>http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/site/site_table.html</A>.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1.  Data for all species may not be available for all sites listed 
in the table.
2.  The exact location of a sampling site recorded in our database
may change or become better defined over time.  The latitude,
longitude, and altitude of a sample event is based on the best
information available at the time of sample collection.  Differences
in sample position associated with a particular site may be due
to the site moving or changes in technology that permit a more
accurate location determination.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - EVENT WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS

On special request we can distribute a "merged" file, which
includes for each sampling event, measurement results for muliple 
parameters or trace gas species.  A merged file does not include all 
information found in a single parameter data file.  For example,
merged files exclude measurement uncertainty, analysis instrument 
ID and date and time for each parameter.  Thus, the single parameter
data file is our most comprehensive data archive. 

The format of a merged file is slightly different from single parameter event file.
A "merged" file will have the word "merge" in the parameter field of the file name.  
The file name does not inform on the number of parameters included in the file.

Merged data files use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     merge_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_[optional qualifiers].txt

(ex) merge_brw_surface-flask_1_arl.txt contains arl measurement results for two or more
     parameters for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information followed by one 
record for each atmospheric measurement of a single parameter or trace gas species.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection date and time in UTC.
Field 3:    [MONTH]
Field 4:    [DAY]
Field 5:    [HOUR]
Field 6:    [MINUTE]
Field 7:    [SECOND]

Field 8:    [FLASK ID] The sample container ID.

Field 9:    [METHOD] A single-character code that identifies the sample 
             collection method.  The codes are:

             P - Sample collected using a portable, battery
                 powered pumping unit.  Two flasks are
                 connected in series, flushed with air, and then
                 pressurized to 1.2 - 1.5 times ambient pressure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA ESRL uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.

FLAGS DESCRIPTION:

'...' is a good sample

1st column flags:

'P..' flag: poor flask pair agreement

Since samples are collected in pairs, the pair difference is calculated.

If the mole fraction x falls between the below margins,
and the difference exceeds abs(dx) the flag is applied.

   x <= 10 and dx > |5|

   11 > x <= 25 and dx > |10|

   26 > x <= 63 and dx > |20|

   64 > x <= 156 and dx > |40|

   157 > x <= 391 and dx > |80|

   392 > x <= 977 and dx > |160|

   978 > x <= 2441 and dx > |320|

   2442 > x <= 6104 and dx > |640|

   6105 > x <= 15259 and dx > |1280|


'A..' flag: no data obtained

This flag is applied when there was an instrument failure or if the amount of air left
in the flask was too low for an analysis

'*..' flag:

This flag is applied when an unstable baseline made the peak integration impossible

'D..' flag:

This flag is applied when this particular compound was below the detection limit
of our measurement

'C..' flag:

This flag is applied when a contamination was found


3rd column flags:

'..C' flag:

This flag is applied when the amount of air left in the flask was too low for the
instrument to draw the standard volume for analysis. In that case an analysis
was performed with a reduced sampling volume.

Note:

We feel that this data set best represents hydrocarbons distribution in the remote,
well-mixed global troposphere. It is possible, and even likely, that some values
represent poorly mixed air parcels influenced by local anthropogenic sources.
Users of these data should be aware that further data screening is necessary.
We will provide advice in selecting the data that will best fit the goals
of user's particular investigation.

8. DATA RETRIEVAL

To transfer all files in a directory, it is more efficient to 
download the tar or zipped files.  

To transfer a tar file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.tar.gz       ! transfer the file
